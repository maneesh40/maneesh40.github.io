                 <h3>Steam condensation studies in the presence of non-condensable gases (NCG) for nuclear containment cooling</h3>
		<img src="img/setup.jpg" width="300px" align= "right"/>

<b>Objective: </b>To experimentally study steam condensation heat transfer in the presence of non-condensable gases<br/> <br/>
<b>Motivation: </b>In the event of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in a nuclear power plant, a lot of steam and hydrogen enter into the containment, which may lead to explosion, jeopardising the safety of the plant and plant workers. To prevent this, steam condensation should take place on the containment walls to remove the heat and relieve the pressure. This condensation is in the presence of non-condensable gases like Hydrogen and air.<br/><br/>
<b>Description: </b>A large-scale experimental facility (shown on the right) has been developed in-house as a part of Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS)-sponsored research project, led by doctoral scholar Mr. Mahesh Kumar Yadav. Experiments were performed for studying heat transfer during film-wise condensation of steam on a test plate for different parameters like bulk pressure, NCG mass fraction, wall subcooling, plate inclination angle etc. Helium was used as a substitute for Hydrogen, considering the explosive nature of the latter. An online mass spectrometer was used to determine the composition of bulk mixture of air, steam and Helium.<br/><br/>The work has till now resulted in two technical papers which have been submitted in the 27th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering (Japan, May 19-24, 2019) for presentation and publication. Their details are: <br/>

<h3> Effect of Inclination angle of the test plate on dropwise condensation of steam on the plate</h3>
<img src="img/m1.jpg" width="300px" align= "right"/>
<b>Objective: </b>To experimentally study the effect of test plate inclination angle on dropwise condensation of steam on the plate<br/><br/>
<b>Motivation: </b>Dropwise condensation is an attractive mode of heat transfer because of its significantly higher heat transfer coefficient as compared to filmwise mode for the same temperature difference. It is also useful in many other applications, such as water distillation, uranium enrichment etc. One of the methods of solar water distillation employs water vapour condensing on inclined plates, the heat transfer in which is not very well documented.<br/><br/>
<b>Description: </b>
The same experimental facility, as described in the previous project, is used to perform experiments for dropwise condensation for different plate inclination angles and wall subcooling while keeping other parameters constant. The plate inclination angle &Theta; (shown on the right) varies from -90&#176;(pendant mode on horizontal plate) to +90&#176;(sessile mode on horizontal plate) in increments of ~20&#176;, in order to fully capture the effect. These inclinations were possible due to the impressive design of the experimental setup which allows 180&#176; rotation in either direction. <br/><br/>The visual data recorded with the help of a digital camera has been compiled for some specific angles in a video for comparison, a screenshot of which is shown below. The video considers one cycle (drop formation to coalescence to sweep) for +90&#176; and compares the visual data for the same time for different inclination angles. The corresponding average heat flux, varying in real time, is shown below each of the visual data for comparison. The research is ongoing and so the video has not been shared.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
We intend to perform more experiments for better understanding of the phenomena. However, it has been difficult to sustain dropwise condensation for longer periods. Thus, currently, some surface modification techniques are being explored. A video showing hydrophobic coating on a surface is shown below<br/>

<h3>B.Tech Project: Design and fabrication of a sugarcane syrup making machine</h3><b><i>Mentored by Prof. P. S. Ghoshdastidar, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur <br/>(August'17-April'18)</i></b><br/><br/>
<b>Objective: </b>To design and fabricate a semi-automatic machine that converts sugarcane juice into its syrup <br/><br/>

<b>Motivation: </b>Farming is becoming increasingly non-remunerative. On the other hand, the food products made from farm produce are getting costlier. So, value addition to the farm produce seems to be a nice solution for farmers to be able to earn more and also provide them with the opportunity to enter new markets. This value addition in agricultural products can be in the form of breads, sausages, syrups etc.<br/> <br/>

<b>Description: </b>Sugarcane syrup making from juice involves mainly three processes: removing dissolved impurities, concentrating the juice and rapid cooling of hot juice (for better taste of syrup). We designed and fabricated this machine in the Central Workshop at IIT Kanpur, catering to each of these three processes. An innovative chain and sprocket mechanism with a skimmer attached to it continuously removes the scum from the surface of the juice as it is heated. The juice is then transferred to the evaporating pan where it is vigorously boiled and concentrated, using waste sugarcane bagasse as fuel. Finally, the hot syrup is passed through the tubes of a shell and tube heat exchanger (designed and fabricated in-house) with water flowing in the shell to quickly cool the syrup. 
This machine can be extended for making syrup of sweet sorghum crop, which is rather less-explored and can help farmers earn a lot because of the medicinal properties of the syrup.<br/><br/>

Internship at Energy Division, Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute <br/>Mentor: Dr. Anil K. Rajvanshi<br/>(May-Jun'17)</i></b><br/> <br/> 
<b>Objective: </b>To study and make a CAD model of the solar water purifier<br/><br/>
<b>Motivation: </b>Solar energy has a lot of potential to not just provide electricity but drive several other processes via heat to help provide clean water, refrigeration, fuel etc. A low cost water purification device working on solar energy can prove very useful for the underserved communities in developing countries in Asia and Africa<br/><br/>
<b>Description: </b>The project involved studying the solar water purifier, an innovation of the institute, by recording the temperature data throughout the day and analysing the temperature profile. Then, the second half of the project involved documentation of the product by making a CAD model and detailed part drawings along with the assembly information. The design was modified so that a user can easily assemble the product <br/><br/>

Mentored by Prof. Nachiketa Tiwari, For course on New Product Design and Prototyping, IIT Kanpur<br/>(January-April'17) </i></b><br/><br/>

<b>Objective: </b>To design and prototype a novel product in order to solve a specific day-to-day problem.<br/><br/>
<b>Motivation: </b>Often, after cooking on a stove, a person may forget to turn off the stove knob. This may especially be the case when he/she is a child or an aged person. The repercussions of leaving the knob on are not just limited to fuel wastage, as it may also cause accidents. Thus, an innovative product was envisioned that will turn the knob off after a pre-set time.<br/><br/>
<b>Description: </b>Working in a team of 7, we identified the need for the product and conducted market research for it. Then, we developed several different concepts and merged them to come up with a final version. Then we prototyped the product and demonstrated its working to our supervisor. <br/>
The product incorporates many innovations:
<ul>        	<li>It is add-on device that can be used on all existing stoves</li>
		<li>Turns the knob off, instead of just giving audio-visual prompts, after a pre-set time using servo motors</li>
		<li>Easy to use as the knob and timer dials are separate. The knob retains its original operation method</li>
		<li>Gas leak sensor shuts off the burner in case of leakage and also sounds an alarm</li>
		<li>Temperature sensor can be used to turn the knob off after a pre-set temp. is reached</li>
</ul>
