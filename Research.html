				<b>Title: </b>Containment Thermal Hydraulics Studies towards Understanding Post-Severe Nuclear Accident Scenario<br/> <br/>
				<b>Summary: </b>The research of my Ph. D. is on the Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) containment safety, and I worked with Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), India and Board of Nuclear and Radiation Sciences (BRNS), India. Although, NPPs are considered as the safest structure with a very low probability of a severe accident (10<sup>âˆ’5</sup> per year for a reactor), few accidents in the past, such as Fukushima, Japan, have jeopardized the viewpoint of the world. Here, the study was carried out on an NPP containment, a last physical barrier of safety. Once loss of coolant occurs in a reactor pressure vessel, large amount of hydrogen and steam enters in the containment structure. From this point, the thermal hydraulics of the containment plays a major role to confine the evolved gasses and radioactivity. There are number of phenomena, such as stratification, mixing, natural circulation, wall and bulk condensation, that occurs in the containment building and governs the progression of severe accident. A Thermal HYdraulic test facility for CONtainment (THYCON) is built to simulate the aforementioned phenomena. The test vessel of the facility (diameter 0.97 m and length 3.6 m) is attached with various accessories and instrumentation. Few of the important instruments incorporated in the test vessel are inverse-heat-transfer based heat flux measurement, online mass spectrometer system, DAQ based pressure sensors and thermocouples. The experiments on the THYCON facility involves different injection heights, volumetric Richardson number and composition of gasses at certain condenser wall temperature and vessel conditions. The stratification is found to be time dependent and exist for large time scales, also, significant stratification is seen at lower volumetric Richardson numbers (~ 0.1). The natural circulation is caused by buoyancy driven upward movement and alternate downward movement near the cold condensing walls. With decrease in inlet flow, the span of circulation zone decreases and confines more in the vicinity of injection location. The condenser located in the vicinity of the circulation zone and experiments at higher pressure have shown higher magnitude of condensation heat flux.

				<b>Title: </b>Analysis of Dispersion of Heated Effluent in Lake Scenario<br/> <br/>
				<b>Summary: </b>In my masters, I explored a live industrial problem of Kakrapar Atomic Power Station, Gujarat, India, regarding waste heat disposal. Practically, all power plant utilizes a large amount of water as a secondary coolant. The utilized water with excess heat is disposed back in the same coast of lake or a water body. A lake is considered as infinite heat sink, however, local temperatures rises significantly thereby severely disturbing the surrounding flora and fauna. The thermal dispersion in the lake depends on convection, turbulence and surface interactions (convection, radiation and evaporative heat transfer on liquid-air interface), which were calculated experimentally in a scale down model. In laboratory experiments, the scales of the coastal area were distorted by considering the important non-dimensional numbers, densimetric Froude number and Reynolds number. The velocity field and the turbulence of the flow were measured by Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The temperature field and heat transfer were obtained from the thermocouples. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that the problem of waste heat dispersion must be studied into two parts: near field dispersion and far field dispersion. The near field heat dispersion is a complex 3 - D problem, which depends on the inlet conditions and immediate surroundings. This zone is most prominent to thermal shocks. An efficient dispersion system such as multiport outlets and artificial vortex generator are some effective solutions to reduce the thermal shocks. The far field heat dispersion is essentially a 2 - D problem. The heat dispersion occurs primarily in the top layer. The temperature distribution depends on near field temperatures and water surface interaction with the environment (wind velocity, surrounding temperatures and humidity).
