				<b>Title: </b>Containment Thermal Hydraulic Studies towards Understanding Post-Severe Nuclear Accident Scenario<br/> <br/>
				<b>Summary: </b>The research of my Ph. D. is on the Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) containment safety, and I worked with Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), India and Board of Nuclear and Radiation Sciences (BRNS), India. Although, NPPs are considered as the safest structure with a very low probability of a severe accident (10<sup>âˆ’5</sup> per year for a reactor), few accidents in the past, such as Fukushima, Japan, have jeopardised the viewpoint of the world. Once the loss of coolant occurs in a reactor pressure vessel, a large amount of hydrogen and steam enters in the containment structure, a last physical barrier of safety. From this point, the thermal hydraulics of the containment plays a major role to confine the evolved gasses and radioactivity.<br>
				We carried the of thermal hydraulics for an NPP containment. There are a number of phenomena, such as stratification, mixing, natural circulation, wall and bulk condensation, that occurs in the containment building and governs the progression of a severe accident. A Thermal HYdraulic test facility for CONtainment (THYCON) is built to simulate the aforementioned phenomena. The test vessel of the facility (diameter 0.97 m and length 3.6 m), attached with various accessories and instrumentation, is shown in Figure. The experiments on the THYCON facility involves different injection heights, volumetric Richardson number and composition of gasses at certain condenser wall temperature and vessel conditions. Experimental data is recorded from the facility through inverse-heat-transfer based heat flux measurement system, online mass spectrometer, DAQ based pressure sensors and thermocouples. We found the stratification is time dependent and exist for large time scales. Also, significant stratification is seen at lower volumetric Richardson numbers (~ 0.1). The natural circulation is caused by buoyancy-driven upward movement and alternate downward movement near the cold condensing walls. With a decrease in inlet flow, the span of circulation zone decreases and confines more in the vicinity of injection location. The condenser located in the vicinity of the circulation zone and experiments at higher pressure have shown the higher magnitude of condensation heat flux.<br>
				Overall, the experimental database and analysis are used for safety analysis, code validation and correlation development, jointly with sponsor organisations (Bhabha Atomic Research Center and Board of Research and Nuclear Science). The work will benefit the research centres and academia for safety assessment, and design of containments and new experiments in the field of nuclear containment safety.

				<b>Title: </b>Analysis of Dispersion of Heated Effluent in Lake Scenario<br/> <br/>
				<b>Summary: </b>In my masters, I explored a live industrial problem of Kakrapar Atomic Power Station, Gujarat, India, regarding waste heat disposal. Practically, all power plant utilizes a large amount of water as a secondary coolant. The used water with excess heat is disposed of back in the same coast of the lake or a water body. A lake is considered as an infinite heat sink; however, local temperatures rise significantly, thereby severely disturbing the surrounding flora and fauna. This necessitates the study of the impact of heated effluent dispersion in lakes.<br>
				The thermal dispersion in the lake depends on convection, turbulence and surface interactions (convection, radiation and evaporative heat transfer on the liquid-air interface), which were calculated experimentally in a scaled-down model. In laboratory experiments, the scales of the coastal area were distorted by considering the important non-dimensional numbers, densimetric Froude number and Reynolds number. The velocity field and the turbulence of the flow were measured by Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The temperature field and heat transfer were obtained from the thermocouples. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that the problem of waste heat dispersion must be studied into two parts: near field dispersion and far-field dispersion. The near-field heat dispersion is a complex 3 - D problem, which depends on the inlet conditions and immediate surroundings. This zone is most prominent to thermal shocks. An efficient dispersion system such as multiport outlets and artificial vortex generator are some effective solutions to reduce the thermal shocks. The far-field heat dispersion is essentially a 2 - D problem. The heat dispersion occurs primarily in the top layer. The temperature distribution depends on near field temperatures and water surface interaction with the environment (wind velocity, surrounding temperatures and humidity).<br>
				The study provided the important scaling parameters, zones of importance in the lakes, the impact of effluent in the near-field and far-field, effet of turbulence and possible methods to eliminate thermal shocks. The current study is extended to the Moticher Lake, Kakrapar Atomic Power Station, India to solve the live problem faced by power plant authorities.
